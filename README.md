**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**
This course focused on exploring various data structures—such as binary trees, hash tables, and linked lists—and understanding how to apply them effectively in different programming scenarios. The main objective was to solve problems by selecting and implementing the most suitable data structure for a given task.

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**
I approached each problem by analyzing the strengths and limitations of the available data structures. I aimed to apply the one that offered the best performance and organization for the task. Understanding data structures is essential because they directly affect how efficiently a program stores, accesses, and manipulates data.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**
Whenever I ran into issues, I consulted official documentation or searched for relevant examples to better understand the method or concept. I also created small-scale prototypes to test logic before incorporating it into the full project, which helped me build solutions incrementally and with more confidence.

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**
This project helped me better understand the importance of performance, especially through Big-O analysis. It also made me aware that I need to improve my ability to think recursively—an area that has implications for designing more efficient algorithms and solutions.

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
Through repeated practice, I’ve developed a more consistent approach to writing clean, modular code. For example, I now have a go-to template for handling file streams, and I’m considering turning other frequently used code into reusable libraries. This makes my programs easier to maintain and adapt for future use.
